                        For over 20 years Skateboarding has been my favorite hobby because it is great 
                        cardiovascular activity and it helps to quiet my mind.

                        I love being out of my element and exploring a new city which is why traveling 
                        is one of my favorite hobbies. Immersing myself in new cultures and learning 
                        how other people live has helped to shape my life perspective in positive ways.

                        Programming is a new hobby of mine but I could not be more passionate about it.
                        I love to sit down with tough programming assignment and spend hours on end
                        slowly whittling away at it. And when the program finally works, the feeling 
                        I get can only be described as a natural high.

                        I am currently employed by the Walt Disney Travel Company and I work within two
                        separate departments. One is the Air Operations department in which I help Disney 
                        guests with airline related tasks like issuing tickets or assisting with canceled 
                        flights. I am also a part of the Guest Services department which aims to makes 
                        guests and/or other cast members happy again when Disney World has made a mistake.

                        Many years ago I worked for a major airline as a flight attendant and as a member of
                        the cabin crew it was my job to ensure the safety of all passengers onboard the aircraft.
                        This meant things like putting out a fire that started mid-flight or administering
                        oxygen to an elderly passenger.

                        When I was young I had one of the funnest jobs I have ever had, the manager of a skateboard 
                        shop. A friend of mine who owned a skate shop in my hometown moved to California and 
                        left me in charge of the shop. Since skate shops are the hubs of skateboard scenes, I 
                        was able to connect to my beloved community in ways I never could before. I also learned 
                        valuable skills at that job like ordering retail inventory and creating seasonal sales.
